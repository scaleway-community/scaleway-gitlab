# Quickstart

Once your server is booted up, it will initialize gitlab, which might take a few minutes.
You can run `scw-gitlab-init-status` to check the initialization status.

You can then configure gitlab using the web interface at `http://your_server_ip/`.

## How to hack

**This image is meant to be used on a Scaleway server.**

We use the Docker's building system and convert it at the end to a disk image that will boot on real servers without Docker. Note that the image is still runnable as a Docker container for debug or for inheritance.
